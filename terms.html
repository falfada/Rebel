          Your subscription and any add-ons will automatically renew at the end
          of the applicable subscription period. Turnaround times are not

        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          Your team will only be assigned once you have submitted your first
          Video Request and completed a customer onboarding session. Please do
          this as soon as possible to avoid any delays since your account will
          remain unassigned but active until your first Video Request is
          received. We will follow up but the onus is on you to submit the Video
          Request.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2 mt-16">
          A Project Manager and Video Editor will be assigned to your account.
          They will be the team who will manage and work on your projects. To
          maximize efficiencies in the workflow and reduce any misunderstanding
          the team will work on your projects one at a time. Only once the
          current active project is tagged as “Completed” will the Video Editor
          start working on the next queued project.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2 mt-16">
          Rebel uses Adobe Premiere Pro as our editing software of choice. You
          will therefore need to provide any assets you wish the Video Editor to
          use to be compatible with Adobe Premiere Pro. If you require working
          files we can only provide Adobe Premiere Pro project files.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2 mt-16">
          Rebel's operating hours are based on Central Time (CST), which is
          GMT-5. During the summer season (March 14 to November 7), our work
          hours are from 9:00 - 18:00 CST. However, during the winter season
          (November 8 to March 13), our work hours are adjusted to 8:00 - 17:00
          CST.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2 mt-16">
          During the final week of the year, we take a company-wide break for
          Christmas and New Year. All clients receive advanced notice of the
          exact days and dates we take off as the break nears.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-800 col-8 m-auto mt-24">Cancellation</h3>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          You may cancel your subscription with Rebel at any time before the end
          of the then-current subscription period. You can cancel your
          subscription by sending an email with your request to
          <a
            href="mailto:success@getrebelcrew.com"
            class="text-black text-underline"

          >.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Rebel
          services and your files through the end of your paid billing term.
          Access to your account files requires an active subscription.
          Cancelled accounts will not have access to their files once their
          billing term has ended.
        </p>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          After 45 days of no editing activity on an order, Rebel reserves the
          right to delete the files, media, and related assets associated with
          the order from our servers and on the storage of Frame.io.

          Money Back Guarantee
        </h3>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          If the customer is using Rebel for the first time they are entitled to
          a 14-day satisfaction guaranteed period to evaluate the quality of the
          service. Provided they’ve canceled during the first 14 days of
          service, they can additionally request a refund by emailing or
          messaging their project manager in the client portal, or sending an
          email to
          <a

            class="text-underline text-black"

          US Dollar and your currency for the day.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-800 col-8 m-auto mt-24">Payment and Refunds</h3>
        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits
          for any partial subscription periods except as provided for in the
          14-day satisfaction guarantee. You further agree that, upon
          registering for the services through the Site, you authorize Rebel to
          charge your method of payment (e.g. credit card or Paypal) for the fee
          on each anniversary of your registration date, based upon your billing
          frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, annually). Your account and access
          to the services provided via the site may be suspended in the event of
          non-payment of applicable fees. You represent and warrant to Rebel
          that such payment information is accurate and that you are authorized
          to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account
          information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing
          address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. Rebel may
          change its fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Site
          with 5 days prior notice, but with no advance notice required for
          temporary promotions or reductions in fees. You, the customer, are
          responsible to use Rebel after payment.

        <p class="col-8 m-auto text-sm line-2">
          While we do our best to minimize any mistakes, due to the nature of

          While we can accept unlimited requests and revisions, our output
          volume depends on many factors, namely depending on the total request
          volume and complexity. We do our best to work with you to accommodate
          any priority items and your timelines. That being said, our suggestion
          is to not use our service for time sensitive requests. Your right to
          use the Rebel services shall terminate upon your breach of any term of
          this Agreement.

          parent companies, or any person who was associated with any such
